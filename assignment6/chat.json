`create_list_pokemon`: Converts each inner list into a dictionary with the appropriate keys and creates `Pokemon` objects.\n   - `list_pokemon`: Calls `create_list_pokemon` to create the list of `Pokemon` objects.\n3. **Data Reading Function**: \n   - `open_pokemon_data`: Reads the CSV file, skips the header line, and splits each remaining line by commas to create a list of lists.\n4. **Error Handling**: \n   - Handles `FileNotFoundError` if the file is not found.\n   - Handles any other exceptions that might occur during the file reading and parsing process.\n5. **Data Verification**: \n   - Prints the first 3 entries of the data to verify the format.\n6. **Object Creation and Printing**: \n   - Creates `Pokemon` objects from the data and prints their details in a readable format.\n\nMake sure the CSV file [`pokemon_data.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Faliteralgodofpianosarahwood%2FProjects%2Fi210b%2Fassignment6%2Fpokemon_data.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22e2154501-d47d-4c84-8b20-4773694c649f%22%5D \"/Users/aliteralgodofpianosarahwood/Projects/i210b/assignment6/pokemon_data.csv\") is in the same directory as your script and contains the necessary columns.

          "value": "If the output is too large, it might be difficult to see all of it in the terminal or console. Here are a few strategies to handle large outputs:\n\n1. **Write Output to a File**: Instead of printing the output to the console, you can write it to a file. This way, you can open the file and view the entire output without any truncation.\n\n2. **Paginate the Output**: You can paginate the output to view it in chunks.\n\n3. **Print a Subset of the Data**: If you only need to verify a subset of the data, you can print just a few entries.\n\n### Writing Output to a File\nHere is how you can modify your code to write the output to a file:\n\n```python\ndef open_pokemon_data():\n    try:\n        with open(\"pokemon_data.csv\", \"r\") as file:\n            contents = file.read()  # reading the contents of the file\n            lines = contents.splitlines()  # splitting the contents by lines\n            columns = [line.split(\",\") for line in lines]  # splitting the lines by commas and saving them to a list of columns\n            data = columns[1:]  # skipping the header row\n            return data\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"Error: The file 'pokemon_data.csv' was not found.\")\n        return []\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return []\n\npokemon_data = open_pokemon_data()\npokemon_objects = Pokemon.list_pokemon(pokemon_data)\n\nwith open(\"pokemon_output.txt\", \"w\") as output_file:\n    for pokemon in pokemon_objects:\n        output_file.write(f\"\"\"\nDex Number: {pokemon.dexnum}, Name: {pokemon.name}, Generation: {pokemon.generation}\nType 1: {pokemon.type1}, Type 2: {pokemon.type2}, Species: {pokemon.species}\nHeight: {pokemon.height}, Weight: {pokemon.weight}\nAbility 1: {pokemon.ability1}, Ability 2: {pokemon.ability2}, Hidden Ability: {pokemon.hidden_ability}\nHP: {pokemon.hp}, Attack: {pokemon.attack}, Defense: {pokemon.defense}, Special Attack: {pokemon.sp_atk}, Special Defense: {pokemon.sp_def}, Speed: {pokemon.speed}\nTotal: {pokemon.total}, EV Yield: {pokemon.ev_yield}, Catch Rate: {pokemon.catch_rate}, Base Friendship: {pokemon.base_friendship}, Base Experience: {pokemon.base_exp}, Growth Rate: {pokemon.growth_rate}\nEgg Group 1: {pokemon.egg_group1}, Egg Group 2: {pokemon.egg_group2}\nPercent Male: {pokemon.percent_male}, Percent Female: {pokemon.percent_female}, Egg Cycles: {pokemon.egg_cycles}, Special Group: {pokemon.special_group}\n\"\"\")\n```\n\n### Printing a Subset of the Data\nIf you only need to verify a subset of the data, you can print just a few entries:\n\n```python\npokemon_data = open_pokemon_data()\npokemon_objects = Pokemon.list_pokemon(pokemon_data)\n\n# Print only the first 3 entries\nfor pokemon in pokemon_objects[:3]:\n    print(f\"\"\"\nDex Number: {pokemon.dexnum}, Name: {pokemon.name}, Generation: {pokemon.generation}\nType 1: {pokemon.type1}, Type 2: {pokemon.type2}, Species: {pokemon.species}\nHeight: {pokemon.height}, Weight: {pokemon.weight}\nAbility 1: {pokemon.ability1}, Ability 2: {pokemon.ability2}, Hidden Ability: {pokemon.hidden_ability}\nHP: {pokemon.hp}, Attack: {pokemon.attack}, Defense: {pokemon.defense}, Special Attack: {pokemon.sp_atk}, Special Defense: {pokemon.sp_def}, Speed: {pokemon.speed}\nTotal: {pokemon.total}, EV Yield: {pokemon.ev_yield}, Catch Rate: {pokemon.catch_rate}, Base Friendship: {pokemon.base_friendship}, Base Experience: {pokemon.base_exp}, Growth Rate: {pokemon.growth_rate}\nEgg Group 1: {pokemon.egg_group1}, Egg Group 2: {pokemon.egg_group2}\nPercent Male: {pokemon.percent_male}, Percent Female: {pokemon.percent_female}, Egg Cycles: {pokemon.egg_cycles}, Special Group: {pokemon.special_group}\n\"\"\")\n```\n\n### Paginating the Output\nYou can use the `more` or `less` command in the terminal to paginate the output:\n\n```python\npokemon_data = open_pokemon_data()\npokemon_objects = Pokemon.list_pokemon(pokemon_data)\n\nfor pokemon in pokemon_objects:\n    print(f\"\"\"\nDex Number: {pokemon.dexnum}, Name: {pokemon.name}, Generation: {pokemon.generation}\nType 1: {pokemon.type1}, Type 2: {pokemon.type2}, Species: {pokemon.species}\nHeight: {pokemon.height}, Weight: {pokemon.weight}\nAbility 1: {pokemon.ability1}, Ability 2: {pokemon.ability2}, Hidden Ability: {pokemon.hidden_ability}\nHP: {pokemon.hp}, Attack: {pokemon.attack}, Defense: {pokemon.defense}, Special Attack: {pokemon.sp_atk}, Special Defense: {pokemon.sp_def}, Speed: {pokemon.speed}\nTotal: {pokemon.total}, EV Yield: {pokemon.ev_yield}, Catch Rate: {pokemon.catch_rate}, Base Friendship: {pokemon.base_friendship}, Base Experience: {pokemon.base_exp}, Growth Rate: {pokemon.growth_rate}\nEgg Group 1: {pokemon.egg_group1}, Egg Group 2: {pokemon.egg_group2}\nPercent Male: {pokemon.percent_male}, Percent Female: {pokemon.percent_female}, Egg Cycles: {pokemon.egg_cycles}, Special Group: {pokemon.special_group}\n\"\"\")\n```\n\nThen, in the terminal, you can run your script and pipe the output to `more` or `less`:\n\n```sh\npython assignment6.py | more\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\npython assignment6.py | less\n```\n\nThis will allow you to view the output one screen at a time.",

Ensure the CSV file [`pokemon_data.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Faliteralgodofpianosarahwood%2FProjects%2Fi210b%2Fassignment6%2Fpokemon_data.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%224335673f-94aa-4e1d-863a-2ec6e4882f2c%22%5D \"/Users/aliteralgodofpianosarahwood/Projects/i210b/assignment6/pokemon_data.csv\") is in the same directory as your script.\n2. Run the script. It will read the CSV file, create `Pokemon` objects, and write their details to `pokemon_output.txt`.\n\nAfter running the script, you can open `pokemon_output.txt` to view the entire output. This approach ensures that you can see all the data without any truncation.",

`create_list_pokemon`: Converts each inner list into a dictionary with the appropriate keys and creates `Pokemon` objects.\n   - `list_pokemon`: Calls `create_list_pokemon` to create the list of `Pokemon` objects.\n3. **Data Reading Function**: \n   - `open_pokemon_data`: Reads the CSV file, skips the header line, and splits each remaining line by commas to create a list of lists.\n4. **Error Handling**: \n   - Handles `FileNotFoundError` if the file is not found.\n   - Handles any other exceptions that might occur during the file reading and parsing process.\n5. **Writing Output to a File**: \n   - Opens a file named `pokemon_output.txt` for writing.\n   - Writes the details of each `Pokemon` object to the file in a readable format.\n\n### Debugging Steps:\n1. **Verify Data Reading**: The `print(pokemon_data[:3])` statement prints the first 3 entries of the data to verify that the data is being read correctly.\n2. **Check File Writing**: Ensure that the file `pokemon_output.txt` is created in the same directory as your script and that it contains the expected output.\n\n### Running the Code:\n1. Ensure the CSV file [`pokemon_data.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Faliteralgodofpianosarahwood%2FProjects%2Fi210b%2Fassignment6%2Fpokemon_data.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22710d25a1-02c3-411b-972f-256a0be7962d%22%5D \"/Users/aliteralgodofpianosarahwood/Projects/i210b/assignment6/pokemon_data.csv\") is in the same directory as your script.\n2. Run the script. It will read the CSV file, create `Pokemon` objects, and write their details to `pokemon_output.txt`.\n\nAfter running the script, open `pokemon_output.txt` to view the entire output. This approach ensures that you can see all the data without any truncation. If the file is still empty, check for any errors in the console output and ensure that the CSV file is correctly formatted and accessible.",
